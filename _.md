# Password Manager Design

## Overview

The goal is to create a password manager where the user can securely store and retrieve passwords using a master password. The master password will be used to derive a secure encryption key for encrypting and decrypting stored passwords.

## Key Derivation

Instead of using the master password directly, we will derive a secure key using a Key Derivation Function (KDF). A popular choice is PBKDF2, which generates a cryptographically secure key from the password.

### Installation of Required Libraries

You'll need the `cryptography` library for encryption/decryption and the `hashlib` and `os` libraries for key derivation:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Key Derivation Function

Here's how to derive a secure key from the master password using PBKDF2:

```python
import os
import hashlib

def derive_key(master_password: str, salt: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Derives a key from the master password using PBKDF2."""
    return hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(
        'sha256',                # The hash digest algorithm to use
        master_password.encode(), # Convert the password to bytes
        salt,                    # Provide the salt
        100000                   # The number of iterations
    )

def generate_salt() -> bytes:
    """Generates a new salt for key derivation."""
    return os.urandom(16)  # 16 bytes is a common size for a salt
```

## Encrypting Passwords

You can now use the derived key for encrypting passwords:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import base64

def encrypt_password(master_password: str, plain_password: str, salt: bytes) -> str:
    key = derive_key(master_password, salt)
    cipher = Fernet(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(key))
    return cipher.encrypt(plain_password.encode()).decode()
```

## Decrypting Passwords

To decrypt the passwords:

```python
def decrypt_password(master_password: str, encrypted_password: str, salt: bytes) -> str:
    key = derive_key(master_password, salt)
    cipher = Fernet(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(key))
    return cipher.decrypt(encrypted_password.encode()).decode()
```

## Database Schema Modification

You will need to store the salt alongside the encrypted password in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE passwords (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    website TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,  -- This will store the encrypted password
    salt BLOB NOT NULL,      -- This will store the salt used for key derivation
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## User Workflow

- **When a user adds a password**:
  1. Generate a new salt.
  2. Encrypt the password using the master password and the generated salt.
  3. Store the encrypted password and the salt in the database.

- **When retrieving a password**:
  1. Retrieve the salt and encrypted password from the database.
  2. Decrypt the password using the master password and the retrieved salt.

## Important Considerations

- **Key Rotation**: If the master password changes, youâ€™ll need to re-encrypt all stored passwords with the new key.
- **Security of Master Password**: Ensure the master password is strong and encourage users to create a secure one.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Plan for how to handle lost master passwords, as they could result in loss of access to all stored passwords.

This method keeps the password manager secure while still allowing you to manage your passwords with a master password. Let me know if you need more details on any part of this process!
